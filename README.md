# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

I created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Take a look at my website https://mcswajl.github.io/mcswajl-Gen-Random-Password/

## Website Story

```
This challenge was difficult for me because JavaScript is new to me and I am 
having a hard time remembering the correct functions, variables, arrays, etc. to use.
I did enjoy using .splice and .join, the join put the caharcterlengths backtogether without the commas
that the splice process created.
It is important that I write things down. I am submitting this challenge early so I can get caught
up on my module work, getting behind in JavaSript lessons is no good.
